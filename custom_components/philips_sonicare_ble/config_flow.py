    A step description can only reference a *whole* other translation

    several outcomes of the same dialog would therefore have to be
    repeated once per outcome and once per language — and a dialog with
    no input fields cannot fall back on ``errors["base"]``, because the
    frontend only renders that inside ``ha-form``.

    Keeping the parts that actually vary as their own keys and injecting
    them as placeholders sidesteps both limits: one step covers what
    used to need five, and the wording still follows the language the
    dialog is rendered in (see ``_async_user_language``). Home Assistant
    overlays the requested language on top of English, so a fragment
    missing from a translation falls back on its English text rather
    than disappearing.

    The blocks live under ``config.error`` next to the real error
    strings: hassfest validates strings.json against a fixed schema and
    rejects a section of our own. Keys are returned with their path below
    the domain (``error.<name>``), so the same lookup also reaches the
    error strings themselves — which is what makes them usable as notices
