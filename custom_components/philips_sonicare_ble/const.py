# the handle, still in a transfer, does not answer again.

# Not every handle keeps its sessions behind a storage service. A Sonicare
# for Kids has none: the same characteristics sit in the brushing service,
# and the two that drive the selection - the kind and the control point -
# are absent. Its data characteristic is readable instead of notifying, so
# the record is selected and then simply read.
#
# Both shapes answer with the same record. The one difference is that a
# notified record is chunked and carries a leading byte for it, which a read
# one has no need of - so the fields sit one byte earlier.
# Every record carries the same fields in the same order, up to and
# including the intensity - that is what makes it a record, and a handle
# sends no more than its own layout fills. The shorter kind ends there, on a
# record of 13 bytes counting the chunk byte; the longer kind adds further
# fields after it, the first of which is the routine id.
#
# So a record is not short for lacking a field it never had. Measuring every
# answer against the longer kind refused the shorter one whole - and with it
# the handle's own account of a session, leaving only the watched fallback.
#
# A record that is read rather than notified comes off a fixed-width
# characteristic and is always this long - the handle pads it out. So the
# length is not a floor there but the shape itself, and a read of any other
# size is a different answer rather than a shorter record.

# record itself: a layout that shifted by even one byte still decodes, into
# numbers that look like an answer. These bounds are what a session cannot
# plausibly be, so an unrecognised format is refused rather than believed.
#
# Observed on real handles: routines of 60, 120 and 160 seconds, and a timer
